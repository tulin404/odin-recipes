        <h2 class="inner-title">Description</h2>
        <p class="inner-texts">These deliciously simple Chicken and Waffle Bites are the perfect fusion of comfort food and crowd-pleasing convenience. Each bite-sized skewer features a piece of crispy, golden-brown popcorn chicken perched on a warm, fluffy mini waffle, finished with a generous drizzle of rich maple syrup. The combination creates a delightful balance of textures and flavors—crunchy, tender, sweet, and savory—all in one mouthwatering morsel.</p>
        <p class="inner-texts">Ideal for brunch spreads, game day snacks, or party appetizers, these bites are quick to assemble and guaranteed to disappear fast. With only three ingredients, they pack big flavor with minimal effort, making them a go-to favorite for both busy home cooks and last-minute hosts. Serve them warm with extra syrup on the side for dipping and watch them fly off the tray.</p>
